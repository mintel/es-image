# Mintel Kubernetes ( Mostly ) Elasticsearch Image

This repository contains the Mintel docker image that we use , mostly , within Kubernetes

## Build Details

The Image builds on-top of the [Official Elasticsearch](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-docker) image and customize the following :

* It only run as unpriviliged user *elasticsearch* (uid:1000 / gid: 1000)
* The indexes are stored in /data
  **if attaching a volume onto /data/ make sure the elasticsearch user can R/W to it**
* JQ is added to the image
* elasticsearch-py python client library is added to the image
* run.sh *entrypoint* is customized to support a series of options / functionalities - see [below](#run.sh-customizations)
* some management scripts are added to enable rolling restarts on Kubernetes - see [below](#lifecycle-scripts)
  Those scripts are meant to be used as [lifecycle hooks](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/container-lifecycle-hooks/) in kubernetes

## run.sh customizations


* On Graceful stop of the java process force sleep a few seconds to allow for other nodes to try to connect to the now stopped-pod and get a connection refuse.
  **This is extremely important when stopping the active master** - you can read more [here](https://discuss.elastic.co/t/timed-out-waiting-for-all-nodes-to-process-published-state-and-cluster-unavailability/138590)
	Time to sleep can be customized by exporting *POST_TERM_WAIT* environment variable (Default to 15s)
* Install plugins at boot by specifying a comma separated list in *ES_PLUGINS_INSTALL* environment variable
* Support defining a custom *SHARD_ALLOCATION_AWARENESS* - TODO: To be improved soon with support with Kubernetes cloud zones
* Customization of *Network DNS Caching TTL* 
  By default this java configuration from upstream will cache positive names forever and negative for a while ( TODO: how long? ) 
	set *NETWORK_ADDRESS_CACHE_TTL* environment variable to define positive caching in seconds ( default to 3s )
	set *NETWORK_ADDRESS_CACHE_NEGATIVE_TTL* environment variable to define negative caching in seconds ( default to 10s )

## lifecycle scripts

a Python script to manage various aspects of the Elasticsearch lifecycle is provided in */manage-es.py* 

A simple set of sh script to be used in *kubernetes* as [lifecycle hooks](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/container-lifecycle-hooks/)  is provided in 

pre-stop hook
```
/stop-data-node.sh

python /manage-es.py pre-stop-data
```

post-start hook
```
/start-data-node.sh

python /manage-es.py persitent-settings
python /manage-es.py post-start-data
```

See the [minikube](#run-in-minikube-example) example for a working example of the definition of those hooks

the following action are supported by the python script
**NOTE: In some cases running this scripts as lifecycle hook can lead to a cluster that can't startup**
* For example all data action expect to be able to contact the cluster masters before proceeding. Is MASTER and DATA functions are on the same node this will never work

*  pre-stop-data - Hook for Pre-Stop of a data node
```
    if mode.upper() == "ALLOCATION":
        # Sequence:
        # - Disable Shard Allocation
        # - Perform a Synced Flush
    elif mode.upper() == "DRAIN":
        # Sequence:
        # - set recovery settings
        # - drain Node
        # - Wait for 0 shards in relocating or initializing status

```
*  post-start-data - Hook for Post-Start of a data node
```
    if mode.upper() == "ALLOCATION":

        # - wait for node to join cluster                                                                                                                                                    
        # - set recovery settings

        # - Wait for 0 Initializing or Relocating Shards ( Unassigned shards should be ok if this is cold startup of an elasticsearch cluster )                           
        # - remove temporary recovery settings  
    elif mode.upper() == "DRAIN":
        # Sequence:
        # - wait for node to join cluster
        # - set recovery settings
        # - undrain Node
        # - Wait for 0 Initializing or Relocating Shards ( Unassigned shards should be ok if this is cold startup of an elasticsearch cluster )
